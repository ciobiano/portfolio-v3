## Introduction

Notey.app is a notes taking app created with simplicity in mind.

## Idea

The idea behind Notey.app was to create a simple and good-looking notes taking web application that was also accessible. It had to be easy to create notes and categorize them,
it also had to be responsive, so it could be used as a [PWA](https://web.dev/pwa) on a mobile phone.

All of these ideas are pretty much fully implemented.

## Future ideas

In the (near) future, there are a few things that I think would be cool to learn and implement into Notey.app. Such as drag and drop,
this would be very beneficial for categorizing notes and great to get experience of.

## Technologies

Notey.app is fully built with [Remix](https://remix.run) and [React.js](https://reactjs.org).
It also uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for the styling of the app, Tailwind CSS allows me to easily create amazing looking styles fast!
