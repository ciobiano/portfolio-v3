In this article, you will learn how to deploy your Next.js application on an Ubuntu VPS with NGINX. We will also cover how to install Node.js and how to set up a firewall.

## Requirements

There are a few things you must have:

- A Next.js project
- <abbr title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</abbr> with Ubuntu 20.04
- Minimal experience in the terminal
- A domain (only required for NGINX proxy)

## Prepare VPS for deployment

There are extra steps that we must perform, so we can properly deploy our Next.js project to our domain.
This includes installing Node.js, installing NGINX and setting up the firewall.

### Installing Node.js

We will install Node.js `v18` using [Nodesource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#readme). To install Node.js, we must first install and run the Nodesource setup script:

```bash --command=true
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo bash
```

This will install the latest Node.js version to our VPS. We can now install Node.js from apt with the following command:

```bash --command=true
sudo apt install nodejs -y
```

To verify that Node.js is installed, we can run the following command:

```bash --command=true
node -v # 18.x.x
```

### NGINX

> NGINX is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.

We will install NGINX using apt. To install NGINX, we can run the following command:

```bash --command=true
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

### Firewall

We must set up a firewall to only allow certain ports on our VPS. We will only allow `22` for SSH, `80` for HTTP and `443` for HTTPS

```bash showLineNumbers
sudo ufw allow ssh # 22
sudo ufw allow "Nignx Full" # 80 and 443
```

To verify this worked, you can run the following command

```bash --command=true
sudo ufw status
```

```bash

```

## Next.js project setup

To clone our Next.js project, make sure to log in to your VPS. We will be using `git` to clone the project from GitHub onto our VPS.

```bash --command=true
# replace this URL with your repo
git clone https://github.com/Dev-CasperTheGhost/nextjs-ts-eslint-template.git
```

<Info title="Don't have git installed?">

  <details>
    <summary>If you don't have `git` installed on the VPS, learn how to install it ðŸ‘‰</summary>

```bash
sudo apt install git -y
```

  </details>

</Info>

Once the project is cloned, we must change the directory to the project folder.

```bash --command=true
cd nextjs-ts-eslint-template
```

Now we can install the dependencies:

```bash --command=true
# Replace this with your package manager of choice
npm install
```

Once all the dependencies are installed, we can build the client so it is ready to be deployed.

```bash
npm run build
```

Now we can start the project in the background using [`pm2`](https://pm2.io). This will start the project on port `3000` in the background.
You can view any logs by running `pm2 logs`.

```bash
# `run start` is the start command that will be executed.
pm2 start npm --name my-project -- run start
```

<Info >
  <details style={{marginTop: 10}}>
    <summary>If you don't have `pm2` installed yet, see the following command ðŸ‘‰</summary>

```sh
sudo npm install --global pm2
```

[Learn more about `pm2` here](https://pm2.io).

## NGINX Configuration

Now that we have our Next.js project running, we can configure NGINX to serve our project.

### NGINX proxy setup

Start by opening the following file with a text-editor: `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`. I will use nano for this.

```bash --command=true
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

_You might already see some configurations, you can safely remove this._

We can now start editing this file and add our own `server` block.

```nginx title="/etc/nginx/sites-available/default"
server {
  # the name of your domain, www is optional.
  server_name my-domain.com www.my-domain.com;

  location / {
    # this must stay localhost. The port must be the same as your Next.js project
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }

  # simple headers
  add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
  add_header X-XSS-Protection          "1; mode=block" always;
  add_header X-Frame-Options DENY always;

  # this will serve the project on port 80
  listen 80;
}
```

Once done editing, save and exit the editor and verify the config file with the following command:

```bash --command=true
nginx -t
```

You may have noticed that we are serving the project on port 80. This is fine for now, since we haven't installed our certificates yet.
If you **do not** need a secure site, you can skip to [#final-deployment-steps](#final-deployment-steps)! Otherwise, continue reading on how to install certificates with [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).

### Installing certificates with Certbot

Certbot can be installed in many ways and on many machines with different configurations, therefore please follow [Certbot's installation guide](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions).

After following Certbot's instructions, you should verify if it changed the NGINX config, open the config file and see changes made.

```bash --command=true
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Now you should see that the `server` block will serve the project on port 443 (HTTPS)!

## Final Deployment steps

As our last step, we must restart NGINX with this simple command:

```bash --command=true
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Now verify that all is running, head over to your domain and see the project in action ðŸŽ‰!

## The end

That's it! You've successfully set up NGINX on Ubuntu and deployed a Next.js project to it
